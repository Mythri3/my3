          All these new tags: header, nav, article, footer, aside and section are as a
          group called section elements. This does not mean the the section element is anything more than just one of them, though you can be excused for assuming otherwise. It took me a while to figure that one out.
          Throughout this tutorial I have repeatedly mentioned that you should always be designing for two audiences, one human the other bots. The header, nav, article, footer, aside and section elements are for that latter audience.
