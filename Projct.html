          In this responsive web design tutorial we will create an awesome responsive HTML5 website starting from scratch. I tried to include as many different features as possible, so we will be dealing with a jQuery slider, CSS3 transitions and animations, CSS Media Queries and so on. This part of the tutorial will show you the HTML structure.

          All these new tags: header, nav, article, footer, aside and section are as a
          group called section elements. This does not mean the the section element is anything more than just one of them, though you can be excused for assuming otherwise. It took me a while to figure that one out.
          Throughout this tutorial I have repeatedly mentioned that you should always be designing for two audiences, one human the other bots. The header, nav, article, footer, aside and section elements are for that latter audience.
          padding-bottom:100px;
          margin-top:60px;
          margin-right: 150px;
          padding-right: 150px;
          Please note that this tutorial is made for people who already have an intermediate knowledge level. Some parts of the tutorial will not be described in detail as it is assumed that you know how to e.g. include a CSS file. If you have any questions you can always use the comment section and I will try to help you.
